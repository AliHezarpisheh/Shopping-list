# Shopping List Terminal App

This project was my very first exploration into Python, where I aimed to learn more about programming concepts. It's a shopping list terminal app with authentication and a buying process. The app is run using `python run.py`.

- **Add Items**: Enter `add` to add item(s) to your shopping list. Separate items with ','.
- **Remove Items**: Enter `remove` to remove item(s) from your shopping list. Separate items with ','.
- **Search Items**: Enter `search` to check the existence of an item.
- **Change Priority**: Enter `prioritize` to change the priority of an item.

- **Help**: Enter `help` to display this guideline again.
- **Quit**: Enter `quit` to finish and exit the store.

**Authentication**: The app includes an authentication system to ensure secure access and personalized shopping experiences.

**Note**: Put ',' between items when adding or removing.
